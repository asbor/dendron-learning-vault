# Dendron Learning Vault

Personal knowledge base that captures my professional journey, academic studies, and ongoing skill development. Everything is organized with [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) so that notes stay searchable, linked, and easy to maintain as the vault grows.

## 📚 Top-Level Domains

| Area | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [[about]] | Personal profile, guiding principles, and current focus areas. |
| [[education]] | Structured learning programs at Orange Business and university coursework for the B.Sc. in Computer Science. |
| [[learning]] | Conference takeaways, tooling guides, and self-directed study aids. |
| [[knowledge]] | Technical references, environment setup instructions, and reusable checklists. |
| [[professional]] | Work experience, competency tracking, and reflections that align with career goals. |

## 🎓 Education Snapshot

- **Orange Business** → [[education.orange-business.data-engineering]] (multi-module academy) & [[education.orange-business.onboarding]] (environment + workflow guides).
- **University** → [[education.academic.data-science]] consolidates IU and STU data science lectures, study goals, and exam prep.

## 🔁 How Notes Evolve

1. Capture concise summaries while learning or delivering work.
2. Link related concepts across domains (e.g., academic theory ↔️ project implementation).
3. Revisit and refine—notes are living documents rather than static archives.
4. Reference original repositories when large datasets or notebooks are required.

## 🛠 Workflow

- **Editor**: VS Code with the Dendron extension.
- **Format**: Markdown + YAML frontmatter for metadata.
- **Navigation**: Wikilinks (`[[note.path]]`), Lookup (`Ctrl/Cmd + L`), and the Dendron tree.
- **Version Control**: Managed through Git for history and collaboration.
