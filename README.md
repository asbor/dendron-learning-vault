# Dendron Learning Vault

This is my personal learning vault built with [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), containing course materials, technical notes, and learning resources organized in a hierarchical knowledge base.

## Contents

### Data Engineering Course
Complete materials from the **Introduction to NoSQL** course:

- **Course Materials**: Introduction, overview, and completion tips
- **NoSQL Fundamentals**: Core concepts and characteristics  
- **Database Types**: Key-value, document, column, and graph databases
- **Architecture**: Distributed systems, CAP theorem, ACID vs BASE
- **Migration**: Strategies for moving from RDBMS to NoSQL
- **Examples**: Real-world patterns and implementation guides
- **Reference**: Glossaries and summary materials

### Structure

The vault follows Dendron's hierarchical organization:
```
data-engineering/
├── course/           # Course structure and materials
├── nosql/            # NoSQL concepts and technologies
│   ├── types/        # Database types (key-value, document, etc.)
│   ├── architecture/ # Distributed systems and design patterns
│   ├── examples/     # Implementation patterns and use cases
│   ├── migration/    # RDBMS to NoSQL migration strategies
│   └── reference/    # Glossaries and summaries
├── skills-pathway    # Complete learning roadmap
└── note-taking       # Documentation strategies
```

## Navigation

- **Root**: `root.md` - Main landing page and navigation
- **Course Entry**: `data-engineering.md` - Main course materials index
- **Quick Access**: Use Dendron's lookup (`Ctrl+L`) to find any note quickly

## Tools and Workflow

- **Editor**: VS Code with Dendron extension
- **Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **Linking**: Wikilink syntax `[[note.reference]]` for easy navigation
- **Organization**: Hierarchical naming for logical structure

## Usage

1. Open in VS Code with Dendron extension
2. Use `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` for note lookup
3. Navigate via tree view or wikilinks
4. Create new notes following the hierarchical naming convention
