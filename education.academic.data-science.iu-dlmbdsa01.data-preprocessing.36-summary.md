# 3.6 Summary

Preprocessing is a crucial step in data science, where raw data undergo cleaning to eliminate noise and errors. Missing values and outliers can either be removed or replaced with reasonable estimates. Duplicate records are checked and often removed to streamline the dataset. Additionally, correlation analysis is employed to identify and mitigate highly correlated variables.

Dataset analysis involves transforming variables for better representation, and three main transformation methods are employed:

1. **Scaling:** This process adjusts a variable's range to match that of other variables, ensuring uniformity for analysis.
2. **Decomposition:** Variables can be split into multiple parts to gain deeper insights into data variations.
3. **Aggregation:** Multiple variables can be merged to create a more comprehensive explanation of the dataset.

Data visualization tools play a vital role in data science, aiding in understanding and presenting data effectively. Some commonly used visualization tools include geomaps, area charts, bar charts, pie charts, combo charts, bubble charts, and heat maps. These tools help convey complex information visually, making it easier to interpret and communicate findings.
