# Git Integration Workflow

Documenting how automated Make tasks interact with Git to produce reliable, repeatable releases.

## Objectives

- Ensure build artifacts and generated documentation are committed consistently.
- Automate repetitive Git commands (status checks, tagging, pushing).
- Maintain clean branches while running scripted workflows.

## Key Steps

1. **Pre-flight Checks** – Use `make status` (or similar) to confirm working tree cleanliness before running automation.
2. **Automated Builds** – Trigger Make targets that compile assets, run tests, or regenerate documentation.
3. **Staging** – Stage generated files explicitly (`git add docs/ reports/`).
4. **Commit Hooks** – Leverage pre-commit hooks to lint Markdown or verify metadata.
5. **Tagging & Release** – Optionally tag releases after successful builds (`git tag vX.Y`), then push both commits and tags.

## Tips

- Keep the `.gitignore` file aligned with automation outputs to avoid noise.
- Run automation in CI to verify the same steps used locally.
- Document branch naming conventions alongside Make targets for clarity.
