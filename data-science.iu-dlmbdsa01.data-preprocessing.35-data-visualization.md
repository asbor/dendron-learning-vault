# 3.5 Data Visualization

Data visualization is adopted to enhance understanding of a dataset via graphical representation (Runkler, 2012). Visualized data are easier to analyze. Common data visualization types include histograms; scatter plots; geomaps; charts (area, bar, pie, combo, and bubble); and heat maps.

## Histogram

A histogram is a graphical display of one variable using different bar heights.

## Scatter Plots

The scatter plot is a graph with two axes on which two variables are plotted to show their correlation.

## Geomaps

A geomap is a geographical map of continent(s), region(s), and/or countries on which the variables’ values are displayed using a color scale.

## Area Charts

An area chart is based on a line chart where the area between the axis and the line represents quantitative variables.

## Bar Charts

A bar chart shows the variables’ values in bar lengths to indicate their densities with respect to other variables.

## Pie Charts

The pie chart is used to show proportions of a whole, where the total of the variables values is 100 percent.

## Combo Charts

The combo chart is used to highlight different types of information and is often used when the variables vary significantly.

## Bubble Charts

A bubble chart is used to visualize a dataset with two to four variables. The first two variables are displayed as axes values, while the third and the fourth variables are displayed as color and size, respectively.

## Heat Maps

A heat map represents the values of variables in terms of a color scale to represent densities within a selected geographical area. The figure below shows the heat map for the places where one football player was most active throughout an entire game.
