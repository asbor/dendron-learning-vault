# Data Science Track

This section consolidates all academic data science materials from IU International University and STU's Intelligent Analysis course.

## Course Index

- [[education.academic.data-science.iu-dlmbdsa01]] – IU Data Science module DLMBDSA01 (introduction through AI techniques).
- [[education.academic.data-science.iau-intelligent-analysis]] – STU Intelligent Analysis course with lectures and practical notebooks.

## Learning Approach

- Capture concise lecture summaries enriched with diagrams and figures from slide decks.
- Link to practical notebooks stored in source repositories instead of duplicating large files.
- Record revision checkpoints and exam tips directly within each module.

## Integration with Orange Business Work

Cross-reference concepts with [[education.orange-business.data-engineering]] to connect academic theory to on-the-job use cases (e.g., NoSQL patterns, ETL automation, and Python analytics workflows).
