# 4.4 Methods and Types of Data Processing

Data processing methods fall into three main categories: manual, mechanical, and electronic.

**Manual Data Processing**: Manual data processing is a primitive method that was used in the early stages of technology development when digital solutions were not widely available. It is still employed today for legacy data that hasn't been digitized, such as historical records, maintenance logs, and patient data. In this method, all data-related calculations, transformations, and logical operations must be performed manually. Manual data processing is slow and is typically used by small businesses and low-capacity governmental offices. Larger companies tend to avoid it due to its time-consuming nature and increased error potential.

**Mechanical Data Processing**: Mechanical data processing involves the use of various devices like printers, calculators, and typewriters to process data. While faster and more reliable than manual processing, it is still considered a relatively primitive method.

**Electronic Data Processing**: Electronic data processing automates data processing using computer applications, software, and programs designed to follow predefined rules. It is fast and highly accurate. Examples of electronic data processing include managing customers' bank accounts and processing university students' grades.

**Types of Electronic Data Processing**: Electronic data processing can be categorized into different types:

| Data Processing Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Batch                         | Input data and/or output information are grouped into batches to permit sequential processing. The tasks from different users are processed (mainly offline) in the order received.           |
| Online                        | This method utilizes internet connections and attached resources (e.g., data centers, high-performance computing equipment). An example of this technique is cloud computing.                 |
| Real-time                     | This approach responds almost immediately to changes in inputs and the requests of outputs. An example is banking transactions.                                                               |
| Distributed (Multiprocessing) | Remote workstations connected to a large server utilize this method. An example is the automated teller machine (ATM).                                                                        |
| Time-sharing                  | A single computing unit is utilized by multiple users according to a predetermined, allocated time slot. Typically used for bulk data processing like census surveys and industry statistics. |
