# 2.4 Summary

Use cases play a pivotal role across various organizations and domains, as they provide essential value propositions. The goal of integrating data science into these domains is to enhance the output value while mitigating risks and reducing task complexities. Here's a clear breakdown of the process:

1. **Identification of Use Case:** The first step involves identifying a suitable data science use case that aligns with the organization's goals.

2. **Data Collection:** Once a use case is chosen, relevant datasets containing essential characteristics are collected. These datasets serve as the foundation for analysis.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** In the preprocessing phase, data is cleaned and refined to handle noise and missing values, ensuring the dataset's quality.

4. **Feature Selection:** The most pertinent data features are selected to construct the prediction model. These features are critical in influencing the model's outcomes.

5. **Model Building:** Depending on the nature of the problem, prediction models are built for either classification or regression tasks.

6. **Performance Metrics:** Metrics are established to assess the performance of both classification and regression prediction models. This evaluation aids in selecting the most suitable model.

7. **Application of Model:** The chosen model is then applied to the dataset, and the generated output is provided to decision-makers.

8. **Business Impact Measurement:** Decision-makers use the output to inform their actions within the organization. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are employed to quantify the success of integrating the output into business operations.

It's important to note that throughout this entire process, human interaction plays a crucial role. However, human biases, both cognitive and motivational, can inadvertently influence the input data and consequently impact the model's output. Therefore, it is imperative to be vigilant in identifying and mitigating these biases to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the entire data science pipeline.\n\n---\n\n## Navigation\n\n- **Parent**: [[data-science.iu-dlmbdsa01.use-cases-evaluation]]\n- **Course**: [[data-science.iu-dlmbdsa01]]\n
