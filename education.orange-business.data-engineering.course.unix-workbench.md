# Unix Workbench

The Unix Workbench is the foundational module of the data engineering course, covering essential command-line skills and tools that every data engineer needs to master.

## Course Overview

This module introduces students to the Unix/Linux command line environment, regular expressions, bash scripting, and build automation tools. These skills form the foundation for all subsequent data engineering work.

## Module Structure

### Regular Expressions and Text Processing

- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering.course.unix-workbench.regex.metacharacters]] - Core regex metacharacters and their usage
- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering.course.unix-workbench.regex.character-sets]] - Character sets and ranges

### Bash Fundamentals

- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering.course.unix-workbench.pipes.basics]] - Understanding Unix pipes and command chaining
- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering.course.unix-workbench.environment.variables]] - Environmental variables and PATH management

### Build Automation

- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering.course.unix-workbench.make.basics]] - Introduction to Make and Makefiles

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. **Navigate the command line** efficiently using Unix/Linux commands
2. **Use regular expressions** to search and process text data
3. **Chain commands** using pipes to create powerful data processing workflows
4. **Manage environment variables** and customize their shell environment
5. **Write Makefiles** to automate build processes and dependencies

## Key Skills Developed

- **Text Processing**: Using grep, sed, awk for data manipulation
- **File System Navigation**: Moving efficiently through directory structures
- **Process Management**: Understanding how Unix processes work
