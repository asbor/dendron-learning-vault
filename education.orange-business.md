# Orange Business Learning

This section documents the structured learning tracks that support my role at Orange Business, combining formal onboarding with the data engineering curriculum.

## Active Programs

A complete training path covering Unix fundamentals, Git workflows, Bash automation, Python for data analysis, and NoSQL databases.

### [[education.orange-business.onboarding]]

## Integration with Daily Work

- **Reference while delivering projects** – Link training materials directly to live initiatives.
- **Capture tool-specific knowledge** – Document custom workflows, scripts, and troubleshooting steps discovered on the job.
- **Identify skill gaps** – Use course outlines to prioritize upcoming learning.

## Next Steps

- Extend the onboarding section with lessons learned from real customer engagements.

- Map additional Orange Business academies or certifications as they become available.
