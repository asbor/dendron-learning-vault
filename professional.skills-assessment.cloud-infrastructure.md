  - Personal laptop: Fedora
  - Previous experience: Ubuntu
  - Server environments: Unraid, Proxmox, Synology, TrueNAS
- **Skills**: Service configuration, user management, networking, Docker and virtualization environments
- **Growth Areas**: Windows 11 adaptation (grew up with Windows but new version is unfamiliar)

## Cloud Platforms

### Basic Level (1)

#### Microsoft Azure
- **Level**: 1-Basic
- **Assessment**: Limited hands-on experience but understand structure and concepts
- **Experience**: Understanding services and deployment concepts from similar environments
- **Learning Path**: Planning to expand practical Azure experience

#### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Level**: 2-Operational (Self-Assessment)
- **Assessment**: General understanding with self-hosted equivalents

- **Experience**: 
  - Master node on Unraid VM
  - Multiple worker nodes
  - Lightweight container services (Jellyfin)
- **Current Focus**: Exploring high availability and scaling
- **Learning Areas**: Production-scale orchestration

#### Virtualization and SDN
- **Level**: 1-Basic
- **Assessment**: Hands-on with Unraid and Proxmox
- **Experience**: Network segmentation principles, VLAN learning, pfSense experimentation
- **Skills**: Understanding virtualization fundamentals
- **Gap**: Direct SDN solutions experience

## Cloud-Native Architecture

### Operational Level (2)

#### Cloud Native & Software Architecture
- **Level**: 2-Operational
- **Assessment**: Apply cloud-native concepts in projects
- **Experience**: Modularity, scalability, and automation principles
- **Limitation**: Limited exposure to production-scale cloud architecture
- **Focus**: Self-hosted environment optimization

## Infrastructure Management

### Self-Hosted Environment Expertise
