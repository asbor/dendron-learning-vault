# 6.6 Summary

In summary, we've explored various approaches in data science for classification and prediction:

**Support Vector Machines (SVM):** This method creates a classification model by establishing a separating boundary between data classes. Support vectors are the data points lying on either side of this boundary. SVM works well for linearly separable data and can handle nonlinear data using the Kernel trick, which projects data into a higher-dimensional space to make it linearly separable. The goal is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes.

**Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):** ANNs are commonly used for nonlinear regression problems. They mimic the structure of the human brain, with layers of interconnected neurons. Each neuron processes its inputs, applies an activation function, and passes the result to the next layer. Training an ANN involves using a dataset to adjust the network's parameters. Backpropagation is a common learning algorithm.

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** RNNs are similar to feedforward neural networks but have feedback connections between neurons. This complexity allows them to handle sequential data and tasks like natural language processing.

**Reinforcement Learning:** This approach, akin to supervised learning, maps inputs to outputs. However, it introduces a reward function that provides feedback to the learner, making it suitable for tasks where an agent needs to learn by interacting with an environment.

**Other Approaches:** In addition to the above methods, there are several other techniques used in data science, including fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and the Na√Øve Bayes classifier. These approaches offer diverse tools for analysis and prediction in various domains.\n\n---\n\n## Navigation\n\n- **Parent**: [[data-science.iu-dlmbdsa01.ai-techniques]]\n- **Course**: [[data-science.iu-dlmbdsa01]]\n
