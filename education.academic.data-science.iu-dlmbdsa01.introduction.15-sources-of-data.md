# 1.4 Sources of Data

Data can be collected from different sources. The main sources of data are:

* **Organizational and trademarked data sources**: Data that is collected by an organization or a trademarked data source.
* **Government data sources**: Data that is collected by a government agency.
* **Academic data sources**: Data that is collected by an academic institution.
* **Web page data sources**: Data that is collected from a web page.
* **Media data sources**: Data that is collected from a media source.

### 1.3.1 Data Types

* **Quantitative data**: Data that is measured in numbers.
  * **Categorical nominal**: Categories that have no order or ranking (e.g., eye color).
  * **Categorical ordinal**: Categories that have an order or ranking (e.g., salary grade, age group).
  * **Categorical binary**: In this subtype data are divided into one of two categories (e.g., gender (male/female)).
  * **Discrete**: Data that can take only certain values (e.g., number of children).
  * **Continuous**: Data that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).
* **Qualitative data**: Qualitative data provide information about the quality of a good or service. Examples of qualitative data are customer feedback about a product, focus group discussions, and answers to open-ended questions.

### 1.3.2 Data Shapes

Data come in one of three shapes (structured, unstructured, or semi-structured) or as a stream.

* **Structured data**: Data that is organized in a predefined manner (e.g., a database).
* **Unstructured data**: Data that is not organized in a predefined manner (e.g., a text file).
* **Semi-structured data**: Data that is organized in a predefined manner but is not fully structured (e.g., a JSON file).

### 1.3.3 The Five Vs of Data

The main obstacles to handling any type of data and describing data overloads are volume, variety, and velocity (the original “3 Vs of data”) and often also veracity/validity and value.

The five Vs of data are:

* **Volume**: The amount of data that is collected.
* **Velocity**: The speed at which data is collected.
* **Variety**: The different types of data that are collected.
* **Veracity/Validity**: The accuracy of the data that is collected.
* **Value**: The value of the data that is collected.
