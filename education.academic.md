# Academic Studies

Tracking my formal education as part of the B.Sc. in Computer Science, with emphasis on data science and intelligent systems.

## Current Modules

### [[education.academic.data-science]]
Comprehensive lecture summaries, study goals, and exam preparation materials across IU and STU courses.

## Study Strategy

- **Pair theory with projects** – Translate lecture material into practical experiments or code notebooks.
- **Maintain revision cycles** – Capture spaced repetition schedules inside module notes.
- **Reference original repositories** – Keep links to the official course notebooks instead of duplicating large datasets.

## Upcoming Plans

- Document additional university modules as they start.
- Summarize project work with reflections and outcomes.
- Track exam requirements and administrative milestones.
