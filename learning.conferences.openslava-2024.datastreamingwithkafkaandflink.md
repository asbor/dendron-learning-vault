Real time data streaming is a critical component of modern data processing pipelines. It enables businesses to react to events as they happen, and to make decisions based on the most up-to-date information. Apache Kafka and Apache Flink are two of the most popular tools for building real-time data streaming applications. In this talk, we will explore the evolution of data streaming with Kafka and Flink in the cloud era, and discuss how these technologies can be used together to build scalable, fault-tolerant data processing pipelines. We will also explore the synergy between data streaming and generative AI, and discuss how these technologies can be used together to build intelligent, real-time applications.
