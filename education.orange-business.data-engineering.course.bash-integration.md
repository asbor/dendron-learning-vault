# Bash Integration Workflows

This module demonstrates how to integrate Bash scripting, Make build automation, Git version control, and GitHub collaboration into complete data engineering workflows.

## Course Overview

Students learn to combine the foundational tools (Bash, Make, Git, GitHub) into integrated development workflows that mirror real-world data engineering practices.

## Module Structure

### Project Example: Guessing Game

The module uses a practical example - a number guessing game - to demonstrate integration concepts:

- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering.course.bash-integration.workflows.guessing-game]] - Complete project example
- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering.course.bash-integration.workflows.makefile-automation]] - Automated documentation generation
- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering.course.bash-integration.workflows.git-integration]] - Version control workflow

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. **Create integrated projects** that combine multiple Unix tools
2. **Automate documentation** generation using Make and Bash
3. **Implement version control workflows** for project development
4. **Deploy projects** using GitHub Pages
5. **Write maintainable scripts** with proper structure and documentation

## Key Integration Concepts

### Automated Documentation

The project demonstrates how to:

- Generate README files automatically using Make
- Include dynamic content (timestamps, line counts)
- Create deployment-ready documentation

### Version Control Integration

- Managing project files with Git
- Creating meaningful commit messages
- Setting up GitHub repositories
- Deploying to GitHub Pages

### Build Automation

- Using Make to orchestrate complex tasks
- Cleaning and regenerating output files
- Managing dependencies between files

## Practical Applications

These integration skills are essential for:

- **Data Pipeline Projects**: Combining scripts, documentation, and version control
- **Automated Reporting**: Generating reports with timestamps and metrics
- **Deployment Workflows**: Creating reproducible build and deploy processes
- **Documentation**: Maintaining up-to-date project documentation
- **Collaboration**: Enabling team members to understand and contribute to projects
