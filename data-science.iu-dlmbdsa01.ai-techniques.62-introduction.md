# 6.2 Introduction

In the realm of supervised learning, classification is the second prominent approach. It involves creating a prediction model from the input dataset to determine the class or category to which a new data record belongs. In this unit, we delve into one of the widely used classification methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM). Additionally, we provide an in-depth exploration of the artificial neural network (ANN), a renowned nonlinear regression model.

We will also touch upon two important concepts: fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. Fuzzy logic helps us gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of a dataset, aiding in identifying missing values. Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, are employed to search for and optimize potential solutions to dataset-related issues in an adaptive manner, progressively reducing uncertainty through ongoing process monitoring. Lastly, we'll introduce Na√Øve Bayes classification, another common method that leverages the Bayes theorem to classify data records based on conditional probability criteria.
