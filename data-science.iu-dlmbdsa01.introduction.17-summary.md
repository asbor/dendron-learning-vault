# 1.5 Summary

Data science is a multidisciplinary field that has borrowed aspects from statistics, pattern recognition, computer science, and operational research. It derives information from data and applies it for predictive purposes. The use of the extracted information depends on the particular application, but in general, it aids an organizationâ€™s decision-making processes.

There are wide-ranging applications of data science in different fields with respect to available data. These applications include industrial processes, organizational workflow, image data, text data, and broadcasting data. Typical sources of data are trademarked companies, governments, academic institutions, Web pages, and media platforms. These data are either quantitative or qualitative, and they are shaped (formatted) as structured, unstructured, or semi-structured. There are five characteristics to be taken into consideration when handling data: volume, variety, velocity, veracity/validity, and value of the input data.

The probability theory and its basic distributions are applied to large datasets to obtain a descriptive sample of the data, and then Bayesian statistics is employed to predict new data values.
