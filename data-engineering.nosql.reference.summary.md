- **Hybrid Solutions**: Combining RDBMS and NoSQL for optimal performance

### 3. ⚡ **Performance vs Consistency Trade-offs**

| **Aspect** | **RDBMS/ACID** | **NoSQL/BASE** |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Consistency** | Immediate | Eventual |
| **Availability** | May be limited | High |
| **Partition Tolerance** | Limited | Built-in |
| **Scalability** | Vertical (scale up) | Horizontal (scale out) |
| **Performance** | Consistent | High throughput |
| **Use Cases** | Transactions, Analytics | Big Data, Real-time Apps |
