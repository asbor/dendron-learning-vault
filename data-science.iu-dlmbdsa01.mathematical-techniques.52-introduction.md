# 5.2 Introduction

In this unit, we delve into the mathematical methods and models that help us turn data into valuable insights. These models serve two primary purposes: clustering input data to uncover patterns and predicting how input data will perform in new situations. When it comes to prediction, we have two main approaches: regression for estimating numerical values (e.g., forecasting a company's future revenue) and classification for categorizing variables (e.g., predicting tomorrow's weather as sunny, cloudy, or rainy).

It's important to note that the best model isn't always the one with the highest training accuracy; it's the one that grasps the data's boundaries and limitations most effectively.

We kick off this unit with a comprehensive discussion of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a widely-used technique for simplifying complex data by focusing on the most relevant variables. We also explore data clustering analysis, which allows us to group similar data records into clusters based on their inherent similarities without labels. Additionally, we delve into linear regression, a method for predicting linear variations in data.

Since many predictive analysis techniques involve time-series data, we've dedicated a separate section to designing forecasting models for such data. Sometimes, it's necessary to transform data into a different domain to enhance understanding and analysis. This might involve switching from a time domain to a frequency domain, for instance. Therefore, we'll also cover fundamental data transformation techniques in this unit.
