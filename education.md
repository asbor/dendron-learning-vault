# Education & Training

This domain brings together all formal learning efforts—from company onboarding to university coursework.

## Orange Business Learning

[[education.orange-business]] – Training initiatives that support my role at Orange Business:

- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering]] – Comprehensive data engineering curriculum and NoSQL specialization.
- [[education.orange-business.onboarding]] – Technical onboarding guides, tool setup, and workflow documentation.

## Academic Studies

[[education.academic]] – Progress toward the B.Sc. in Computer Science:

- [[education.academic.data-science]] – Data science lectures, study guides, and university exam preparation.

## How This Section Evolves

- New programs start with a high-level index note before expanding into detailed modules.
- Archived materials are summarized and linked rather than duplicated from original repositories.
- Cross-links connect practical Orange Business experience with academic theory to reinforce learning.
