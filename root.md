# Welcome to My Learning Vault

This Dendron vault contains my personal learning materials, course notes, and technical documentation. It's organized using Dendron's hierarchical structure to make knowledge easily discoverable and interconnected.

## Current Content

### Data Engineering Course Materials
[[data-engineering]] - Complete materials from the Introduction to NoSQL course, including:

- **[[data-engineering.course]]** - Course structure, modules, and learning path
- **[[data-engineering.nosql]]** - NoSQL database concepts, types, and architecture  
- **[[data-engineering.skills-pathway]]** - Full data engineer learning roadmap

### Getting Started
- [[tutorial]] - Dendron tutorial and basic operations

## Navigation Tips

- Use `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to lookup notes
- Use `[[` to create wikilinks between notes
- Browse the tree view to see the hierarchical structure
- Click on any `[[note.reference]]` to navigate directly

## Organization Philosophy

This vault follows a hierarchical naming convention:
- `subject.topic.subtopic` for detailed organization
- Clear, descriptive titles for easy scanning
- Cross-linking between related concepts
- Reference materials grouped for quick access
