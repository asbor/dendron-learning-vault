# Learning Vault Overview

Welcome to the consolidated hub for my professional development, academic studies, and supporting knowledge resources. The vault is intentionally concise—each note captures key takeaways, links deeper references, and stays aligned with active goals.

- [[education]] – Structured learning programs spanning Orange Business academies and university coursework.
- [[learning]] – Conferences, tools, and self-directed study materials.
- [[knowledge]] – Technical references, setup guides, and reusable checklists.
- [[professional]] – Career history, skills assessments, and reflections.

## Education Highlights

- [[education.orange-business.data-engineering]] – Multi-module data engineering curriculum (Unix, Git, Bash, Python, NoSQL).
- [[education.orange-business.onboarding]] – Environment setup, ETL workflows, SSIS tutorials, and Power BI guides.

## Keep Exploring
