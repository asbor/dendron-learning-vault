# About Me

I am a senior software engineer at **Orange Business** with a strong background in automation, data engineering, and software development. In parallel, I am pursuing a **B.Sc. in Computer Science**, with a focus on data science and intelligent systems.

This vault captures my continuous learning journey—balancing professional development, academic studies, and self-directed exploration.

## Current Focus

- **Orange Business** – Building enterprise data platforms, modernizing ETL processes, and supporting analytics teams.
- **Computer Science Degree** – Advancing through formal coursework in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
- **Personal Knowledge Base** – Maintaining a curated, cross-linked set of notes that grows alongside my career and studies.

## Learning Principles

1. **Capture once, refine often** – Every note is a living document that should evolve as understanding deepens.
2. **Link ideas across contexts** – Connect academic theory with practical experience to reinforce knowledge.
3. **Keep it actionable** – Summaries, checklists, and workflows are prioritized over exhaustive transcripts.
4. **Invest in clarity** – Concise, well-structured notes prevent overwhelm and make revision effortless.

## Roadmap

- Complete the **Orange Business onboarding and data engineering curriculum**.
- Finish core **data science modules** as part of the B.Sc. program.
- Expand the knowledge base with focused references, tooling guides, and project retrospectives.
