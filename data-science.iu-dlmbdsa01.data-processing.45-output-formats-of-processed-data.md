# 4.5 Output Formats of Processed Data

When presenting processed data, it's essential to use formats that meet specific criteria:

1. **Computer-Friendly**: Data files should be in formats that computers can easily analyze.
2. **User-Recognizable**: People should be able to identify data fields and understand the range of values.
3. **Standardized**: Formats should be popular and standard, allowing data to be integrated with other resources.
4. **Clarity**: Data should convey information clearly without unnecessary complexities, such as high correlation or redundancy.

Processed data can take various forms, including:

* **Plain Text Files**: Readable by users and exported as Notepad files.
* **Charts**: Used to visualize trends and progress or decay.
* **Maps**: Suitable for spatial data representation.
* **Images**: Ideal for graphical data.
* **Software-Specific Formats**: Designed for further analysis and processing.

Here are some common software-specific data formats:

1. **XLS (Excel Spreadsheet)**: Created by Microsoft for Excel. Organizes data into tables with rows and columns, allowing for chart creation.
2. **CSV (Comma-Separated Value)**: Each line represents a data record, with values separated by commas.
3. **XML (Extensible Markup Language)**: Contains structured non-tabular data with annotations, often used for web sharing.
4. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: Utilized for transmitting data records with variable-field pairs among different operating systems.
5. **Protobuf (Protocol Buffers)**: A reduced version of XML for efficient inter-application communication, notably used at Google.
6. **Apache Parquet**: A column-oriented database format for big data processing in the Hadoop ecosystem. Provides efficient data access and compression, even for nested structures.
7. **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: Not a file format but a query language for databases. Enables descriptive queries, including joining, selecting, grouping, and filtering tabular data.

These formats cater to various data processing needs and preferences, ensuring that data is both accessible and comprehensible.
