# 1.2 Overview of Data Science

Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured [**data**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. [**Data Science**](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] is related to [**data mining**](#user-content-fn-3)[^3], machine learning and big data. Data Science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and [**information**](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] science.

The main drivers of the emerging field of Data Science are the increasing volumes and availability of data, faster and cheaper computers, and the desire to gain insights from the data.

Data science is an intrinsically data-driven and cross-/interdisciplinary field comprising many distinct overlapping capabilities. These capabilities include:

* artificial intelligence (machine learning approaches in particular);
* data mining;
* pattern recognition;
* knowledge discovery (KDD);
* database storage and data processing;
* data visualization;
* statistics; and
* neurocomputing.

### 1.1.1 Data Science Terms

* **Artificial intelligence**: The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
* **Machine learning**: is a subset of artificial intelligence that creates numerical models to predict future events or new data. Predictions are expressed as probabilities (0-100%), probability density functions, or numbers with associated uncertainty. Results are assessed using predefined accuracy metrics and converted into business decisions based on objectives and key performance indicators.\
  \
  Two main types of machine learning exist: [**supervised**](#user-content-fn-5)[^5] and [**unsupervised**](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]. Unsupervised learning, like cluster analysis, groups data records into clusters where records in the same cluster are more similar to each other. The degree of similarity is determined by domain experts.\
  \
  Supervised learning has two forms: classification, which categorizes data into predefined classes, and regression, which predicts a target variable's value based on input variables.\
  \
  Reinforcement learning, a third type, involves defining an objective and allowing the computer to learn the best approach to achieve it.
* **Training and testing sets**: A training set is a dataset used to train a model. In machine learning, a common task is classification, where the goal is to determine the class label of a new instance. To do this, we first need to build a model using a training set, which consists of instances whose class labels are known. A testing set, or hold-out set, is a dataset used to test a trained model.
* **Data variables**: A variable is a characteristic, number, or quantity that increases or decreases over time, or takes different values in different situations.
* **Types of errors**: There are two types of errors in statistics: Type I and Type II. Type I errors occur when we reject a true null hypothesis. Type II errors occur when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis.

Sensitivity and specificity represent the true positive rate and true negative rate, respectively.

* **Sensitivity**: The ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease <mark style="color:orange;">**(true positive rate)**</mark>.\
  $$sensitivity=1- \frac{type\ II\ error}{number\ of\ real\ positives}$$
* **Specificity**: The ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease <mark style="color:orange;">**(true negative rate)**</mark>.\
  $$Specificity=1- \frac{type\ I\ error}{number\ of\ real\ negatives}$$
* **ROC curve**: A graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.

### 1.1.2 Data Science Applications

* **Industrial processes applications**: Data science is being used to improve the efficiency of industrial processes in many different industries. For example, in the oil and gas industry, data science is being used to optimize the production of oil and gas, and to predict the failure of equipment.
* **Business applications**: Data science is being used to improve the efficiency of business processes in many different industries. For example, in the retail industry, data science is being used to optimize the supply chain, and to predict the demand for products.
* **Text data applications**: Data science is being used to analyze text data in many different industries. For example, in the legal industry, data science is being used to analyze legal documents, and to predict the outcome of legal cases.
* **Image data applications**: Data science is being used to analyze image data in many different industries. For example, in the medical industry, data science is being used to analyze medical images, and to predict the outcome of medical procedures.
* **Medical data applications**: Data science is being used to analyze medical data in many different industries. For example, in the medical industry, data science is being used to analyze medical data, and to predict the outcome of medical procedures.
