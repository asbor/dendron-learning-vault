## Overview

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes are a fundamental part of data integration and data warehousing. They consist of three main stages:

1. **Extract**: This is the process of retrieving raw data from various source systems such as databases, flat files, or APIs. The goal is to gather data from different systems, which might have different formats or structures.

2. **Transform**: Once data is extracted, it is transformed into a suitable format for the target system. This can include cleaning data (e.g., handling missing values), applying business rules, aggregating, filtering, joining, or even reformatting data to match the structure of the target system.

3. **Load**: In the final stage, the transformed data is loaded into the target system, typically a data warehouse or a database. This can be done in bulk (batch loading) or incrementally (real-time loading), depending on the requirements.

ETL processes are essential for organizations that need to consolidate data from various sources into a unified view for reporting, analytics, and decision-making.
