## Genetic Algorithm

The genetic algorithm (GA) is a problem-solving approach inspired by natural selection. It begins by creating a population of potential solutions and then employs selection rules to randomly choose individuals from the current population as parents. These parents undergo crossover, combining their genetic traits to produce offspring for the next generation. Mutation is also applied, introducing random changes to the parents, leading to diverse offspring. Over multiple generations, the population gradually moves closer to the optimal solution, which consists of offspring with the best genetic combinations.

## Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy logic is closely associated with the theory of fuzzy sets, which deals with object classes having imprecise boundaries. The membership in these classes is determined by degrees of truth rather than the usual binary assignments of {+1, –1}. Fuzzy logic starts by transforming input values into truth values, which are real numbers ranging from "0" (completely false) to "1" (completely true). Fuzzy output is computed through the application of "IF-THEN" rules, similar to Boolean logic operators ("AND," "OR," and "NOT"). Finally, a de-fuzzification step is performed to convert the fuzzy truth values into a continuous output value.

## Naïve Bayes Classification

The Naïve Bayes method is a classification approach based on Bayes' theorem, designed particularly for categorical data. In this method, a new data record is assigned to the class with the highest probability of it belonging to that class. Naïve Bayes assumes that the independent variables are random variables, allowing it to calculate the required probabilities even when they have very few values.
