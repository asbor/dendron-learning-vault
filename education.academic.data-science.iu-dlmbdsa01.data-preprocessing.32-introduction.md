# 3.2 Introduction

&#x20;to Weather Data Analysis

In this case study, we delve into the data collected by the Swedish energy company Vattenfall, which comprises weather observations recorded every minute over a period of 274 days. However, upon closer examination, data scientists identified several issues within the raw dataset:

1. **Missing Values**: Instances where data points are absent.
2. **Outliers**: Unusual and extreme data points that stand out from the norm. For example, a wind speed observation of 171 m/s or an ambient temperature reading of 61.757Â°C.

Addressing these data issues requires two significant activities:

**1. Data Transmission:** The first task involves transmitting the weather data from sensors and various devices to the data scientists' computers. This process can be manual or electronic and is essential for making the data accessible for analysis.

**2. Data Cleaning:** The second crucial activity revolves around cleaning the dataset, rectifying errors in the form of missing values and unusual data points. This task often demands domain expertise and specialized knowledge to determine the underlying reasons for these discrepancies. For instance, is there a malfunctioning sensor contributing to missing or erroneous data?

Moreover, two "hidden" activities are integral to this process:

**1. Variable Transformation:** Variables with differing scales are transformed into a consistent scale, ensuring that all data variables are treated equally and carry the same weight in subsequent analyses.

**2. Data Visualization:** The second hidden activity involves visualizing the dataset's variables. This visualization aids in the discovery of data errors, identification of variable correlations, and gaining insights into the underlying data structure.

In summary, this unit will encompass these four core activities, providing valuable insights into data collection, cleaning, transformation, and visualization, all of which are essential components of effective data analysis in real-world scenarios.
