# 5.7 Transformation Approaches

Dataset transformation involves the application of a mathematical function ($$f$$) to each individual data variable ($$x_i$$). Consequently, each original variable ($$x_i$$) is replaced with a transformed counterpart ($$X_i$$), determined by the function.

Mathematically, this transformation can be expressed as:

$$X_i = f(x_i)$$

The primary objective behind dataset transformation is to enhance its interpretability and shift the variables into a new space. This new space may offer advantages, such as moving from Cartesian coordinates to radial coordinates, where more relevant and informative variables can be readily extracted and utilized for further analysis.

## 5.7.1 Logarithm Transformation

The logarithm transformation, denoted as $$\log(x)$$, is a commonly used technique in data analysis, particularly in the context of linear regression problems. It is employed when the developed model lacks linearity between the input variables. 

For example, when dealing with a dataset representing a country's population, applying a logarithm function to the variables can result in a transformed dataset that exhibits a more nearly linear variation, which is often desirable for regression analysis.

The visual representation above illustrates the impact of the logarithm transformation on the data distribution, showcasing how it can help achieve a closer-to-linear relationship between variables.

## 5.7.2 Power Law Transformation

The power law transformation, expressed as $$X = x^{\gamma}$$, is a group of transformations characterized by a nonnegative parameter ($$\gamma$$). In practice, the value of $$\gamma$$ is typically estimated initially and then continually adjusted or optimized during the model training phase to attain the highest level of performance accuracy.

The image above illustrates the concept of the power law transformation, demonstrating how it can modify the distribution of data depending on the chosen value of $$\gamma$$. This transformation is a flexible tool that can be employed to adapt data to better suit the requirements of specific analyses or modeling techniques.

## 5.7.3 Reciprocal Transformation

The reciprocal transformation, denoted as $$X = \frac{1}{x}$$, is a mathematical technique that alters the form of a variable to its reciprocal or inverse. This transformation is particularly valuable when the inverse of a variable is more meaningful for data analysis. 

For instance, consider a dataset where values represent the number of students per teacher. Applying the reciprocal transformation would yield the number of teachers per student, which might be a more relevant and interpretable measure for certain analyses.

## 5.7.4 Radial Transformation

The radial transformation is a technique that centers on measuring the distance between a variable's value and the origin point. It involves the combination and conversion of two variables, denoted as ($$x_1$$) and ($$x_2$$), into radial coordinates. These radial coordinates consist of two components:

1. Radius ($$r$$): Calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual variables ($$r = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$$). It represents the distance of the point from the origin.

2. Angle ($$\varTheta$$): Determined as the arctangent of the ratio of the two variables ($$\varTheta = \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{x_1}{x_2}\right)$$). It specifies the angle between the line connecting the point to the origin and a reference axis.

In essence, the radial transformation allows us to express data points in terms of their distance from the origin and their angular orientation, providing a different perspective for analysis.

## 5.7.5 Discrete Fourier Transform

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a mathematical tool used to convert a variable within a dataset from its original domain, such as a variable ($$x$$) plotted against time ($$t$$), into its frequency domain. In the frequency domain, we can analyze the spectrum of the variable ($$x$$) as it relates to different frequencies ($$f$$). Essentially, the DFT helps us identify which frequencies make up the distribution of the variable.

The formula for the Discrete Fourier Transform is as follows:

$$X_n = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} x_k e^{-i2\pi kn/N}$$

Here, $$N$$ represents the length of the selected frequency band or the number of data points in the dataset.
