## Why NoSQL Skills Matter

- **Industry demand:** Analysts project the NoSQL market to grow by more than 30% annually through 2030, surpassing $38 billion in revenue.
- **Career impact:** Professionals with NoSQL expertise command salaries ranging from approximately $78,000 to $138,000 USD.
- **Job outlook:** The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an average hourly wage of $53 for comparable roles and anticipates roughly 8% job growth.

## Who This Course Is For

- Aspiring data professionals exploring database engineering roles.
- Practitioners who already manage databases and want to broaden their toolset.
- Learners who prefer a guided, beginner-friendly path without assuming prior NoSQL experience (familiarity with databases and SQL is helpful but not required).

## What You Will Learn

By the end of the course you will be able to:

1. Explain the history and categories of NoSQL systems, including their architectural motivations.
2. Compare consistency models, including ACID versus BASE trade-offs, and describe distributed database fundamentals such as the CAP theorem.
3. Work with two leading NoSQL databases—MongoDB and Apache Cassandra—covering CRUD operations, replication, sharding, and data modeling.
4. Apply your knowledge in a peer-reviewed project that demonstrates real-world problem solving.
5. Extend your expertise with an optional IBM Cloudant module for cloud-hosted NoSQL workloads.

## Learning Experience Highlights

- **Hands-on practice:** Engage with labs, shell-based exercises, and short projects to reinforce each concept.
- **Assessments:** Check your progress with quizzes, culminating in a graded final assessment.
- **Community support:** Participate in the discussion forums to collaborate with peers and instructors.
- **Optional enrichment:** Explore IBM Cloudant to gain additional cloud skills once you complete the core modules.

## Next Steps

1. Continue to the course overview to understand the full module breakdown.
2. Schedule time for videos, readings, labs, and discussions each week.
3. Reach out in the forums whenever you need guidance—the instructional team is ready to help.
4. Dive in and enjoy the journey into the world of NoSQL!
